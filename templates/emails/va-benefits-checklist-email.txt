**Veteran Tip**: Before contacting the VA, check your eligibility online in under 5 minutes:
1. Visit: https://www.va.gov/education/eligibility/
2. Log in to eBenefits or VA.gov with your DS Logon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me account
3. View your Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and remaining entitlement

**VET TEC Quick Guide** (High-Demand Tech Training):
- **What it covers**: Coding bootcamps, cybersecurity, data analytics, UX/UI design, IT certifications
- **Cost**: $0 tuition (VA pays provider directly) + housing allowance during training
- **GI Bill impact**: Does NOT use your GI Bill entitlement (you keep all 36 months for degree programs)
- **Eligibility**: Must have at least 1 day of GI Bill entitlement remaining OR be eligible but haven't used it yet
- **Approved Providers**: https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/vettec-high-tech-program/

**GI Bill Housing Allowance Rates** (Examples for 2025):
- New York, NY: ~$3,600/month
- San Francisco, CA: ~$4,200/month
- Austin, TX: ~$2,100/month
- Online-only programs: $1,008/month (half of national average)

**Maximize Your Benefits Strategy**:
1. **Use VET TEC first** for tech skills (preserves GI Bill)
2. **Use Post-9/11 GI Bill for 4-year degree** (tuition + housing + books)
3. **Use Yellow Ribbon** if attending expensive private school (covers tuition gap)
4. **Transfer unused benefits** to spouse/children (requires 4+ years additional service commitment)

**Next Steps After Eligibility Confirmation**:
1. Apply for VA education benefits (VA Form 22-1990): https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/
2. Get accepted to VA-approved school or VET TEC provider
3. Submit enrollment verification to school's VA certifying official
4. Receive Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from VA (typically 30 days)
5. School certifies your enrollment to VA
6. Receive housing allowance monthly (direct deposit to your bank)

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Using GI Bill for short courses when VET TEC would cover it (wastes entitlement)
- ❌ Enrolling in non-approved schools (verify school code first)
- ❌ Not submitting enrollment verification each term (delays payments)
- ❌ Dropping classes without notifying VA (you may owe money back)
