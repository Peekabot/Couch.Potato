**Veteran Tip**: Many AHA instructors offer 10-15% military discounts but don't advertise it publicly. Always ask! If you're forming an LLC or running a business, CPR certification can reduce your liability insurance premiums and is often required for certain business licenses.

**Next Steps After Booking**:
1. Complete any required online pre-work (if blended course)
2. Arrive 15 minutes early with ID and payment
3. Participate in hands-on CPR practice and skills test
4. Receive AHA eCard certification (typically same day or within 24 hours)
5. Add certification to your resume, LinkedIn, and business credentials

**Cost Savings Tip**:
- If you're a business owner, CPR training costs may be tax-deductible as a business expense (consult your CPA)
- Group rates: Bring 3-5 employees/colleagues and ask about group discounts (often 15-20% off per person)

**Where to Add Your Certification**:
- Resume/CV: Under "Certifications" or "Professional Development"
- LinkedIn: Add to "Licenses & Certifications" section
- Business Website: "Our team is AHA CPR/First Aid certified" (builds client trust)
- Insurance Applications: May qualify for lower liability premiums

Good luck and stay safe! 🎖️
