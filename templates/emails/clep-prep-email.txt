Subject: CLEP Exam Credit Transfer Request - [Your Name]

Dear [Academic Advisor / Registrar Name],

I am a veteran currently exploring ways to accelerate my degree completion using the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). I am interested in earning college credit through CLEP exams in the following subjects:

[ ] Business
[ ] Information Technology
[ ] Mathematics
[ ] English Composition
[ ] History
[ ] Other: _________________________

Could you please provide the following information to help me plan my CLEP exam strategy?

1. **CLEP Credit Policy**: Does [College/University Name] accept CLEP credits? If so, which exams are accepted and what minimum score is required (typically 50)?

2. **Credit Equivalency**: Which specific course credits can I earn by passing each CLEP exam? (For example, does the Business Law CLEP replace BUS 201?)

3. **Maximum Credits**: Is there a limit on how many CLEP credits I can transfer toward my degree?

4. **GI Bill Coordination**: Can I use my GI Bill benefits to cover CLEP exam fees or prep courses? If not, are there veteran discounts or fee waivers available?

5. **Registration Process**: Once I pass a CLEP exam, what is the process for submitting my scores and receiving credit? Is there a fee to post CLEP credits to my transcript?

6. **Testing Center**: Does the college have an on-campus CLEP testing center, or should I schedule at a local testing site through the College Board?

**My Background**:
- Veteran Status: [Branch, Years of Service]
- Current Enrollment: [Full-time / Part-time / Prospective Student]
- Degree Program: [Your Major/Degree]
- GI Bill Benefits: [Post-9/11 GI Bill / Montgomery GI Bill / VET TEC / Other]

I am eager to leverage CLEP to reduce my time to degree and save on tuition costs. Please let me know if you need any additional information from me, such as my DD-214 or Certificate of Eligibility.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,

**Next Steps After Receiving Response**:
1. Choose 1-3 exams aligned with your degree requirements

3. Schedule your exam at a local testing center (find centers: https://clep.collegeboard.org/test-center-search)
4. Pass and submit scores to your college registrar

**Cost Savings Example**:
- Average CLEP exam fee: $89
