- **Monthly board update** (if funded): financials, roadmap adjustments

## Appendix: Critical Path

```
Week 1-2: Partner recruitment + Intake form
    ↓
Week 3-4: Pilot client execution (proof of concept)
    ↓
Week 5-6: CCXT starter kit + client portal
    ↓
Week 7-8: Legal templates + attorney packet
    ↓
Week 9-10: Training content + billing setup
    ↓
Week 11-12: Public launch + first revenue
```

**Critical bottleneck**: Attorney partner recruitment (must complete by Week 2 or delay all legal deliverables).
