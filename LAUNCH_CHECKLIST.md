Subject: Partnership pilot — help Albany veterans form trusts and businesses

Hi [Name],

I run a veteran program helping vets form LLCs, set up trusts, and get
fully onboarded for business in 6 weeks.

Pilot: 8 veterans, $750-$2,250 each (50% subsidized), 6-week timeline.

Deliverables: LLC/Corp formation, trust drafting, bank accounts, workshops.

Can we schedule 20 minutes this week to discuss?

Best,
Asa
[Phone] | [Email]
```

**Send to both** VCHS Albany and Soldier On NY directors

## 📈 WEEK 1 GOALS

**By Friday (7 days from now)**:

- [ ] 1 partner organization interested (VCHS or Soldier On)
- [ ] 1 attorney partner signed (for Growth package delivery)
- [ ] 3-5 intake form submissions
- [ ] 1-2 discovery calls scheduled
- [ ] 1 pilot client onboarded ($500-$1,500 revenue)

**If you hit these goals**: You have a validated business, not just a plan

---

## 🚨 COMMON BLOCKERS & FIXES

**Blocker**: "I don't know what to say on discovery calls"
**Fix**: Use this script:
```
Thanks for filling out the form. Tell me about your goals—
are you interested in estate planning, starting a business, or both?
[Listen]
Based on that, I'd recommend the [Starter/Growth] package.
Here's what we'll deliver and the timeline...
[Walk through deliverables]
Does that align with what you're looking for?
```

**Blocker**: "No one is filling out the intake form"
**Fix**: You need traffic. Post resource hub in 5 veteran Facebook groups today.

**Blocker**: "Partner orgs aren't responding"
**Fix**: Call them. Email has 20% open rate, phone has 80% connection rate.

**Blocker**: "I don't have an attorney partner yet"
**Fix**: Only sell Starter packages ($1,500) until you recruit 1 attorney. Starter doesn't need attorney (just intake + entity formation).

---

## 💰 REVENUE TIMELINE

**Week 1**: $0 (setup week)
**Week 2**: $500-$1,500 (first Starter client)
**Week 3**: $1,500 (second Starter client)
**Week 4**: $4,500 (first Growth client, if attorney partner signed)

**Month 1 Total**: $6,500-$7,500
**Month 2 Target**: $12,000 (2 Growth clients)
**Month 3 Target**: $20,000 (1 Growth/week + 1 Enterprise)

---

## ⏰ TIME BUDGET

**How to spend your time this week**:

- **40% Marketing** (post in veteran groups, send partnership emails)
- **30% Sales** (discovery calls, follow-ups)
- **20% Delivery** (if you get a client, execute Starter package)
- **10% Operations** (attorney recruitment, process refinement)

**Do NOT spend time on**:
- Building features no one asked for (CCXT full platform, Discord server, training videos)
- Perfecting website design (resources.html is good enough)
- Writing blog posts (you need clients first, content second)

---

## 🎯 THE ONE METRIC THAT MATTERS

**Discovery calls booked this week**: Target 3-5

**Why**:
- 3-5 calls = 1-2 clients (30-40% close rate)
- 1-2 clients = $500-$6,000 revenue
- Revenue = validation

**How to get calls**:
1. Post resource hub in veteran groups (2-3/day)
2. Partnership referrals (VCHS/Soldier On)
3. Direct outreach (message veterans on LinkedIn)

---
