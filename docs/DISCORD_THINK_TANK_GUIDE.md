## Why Discord Over Alternatives?

| Platform | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| **Discord** | Real-time, voice/video, free, gaming/tech culture fit | Not as professional as Slack, less searchable | ✅ **Best for community think tank** |
| **Slack** | Professional, better threading/search, integrations | Expensive ($7.25/user/mo), less social | ❌ Too corporate, cost prohibitive |
| **Telegram** | Encrypted, simple, mobile-first | No voice channels, limited bots | ❌ Too basic for think tank needs |
| **Circle** | Built for communities, courses, paid tiers | $89-$219/mo, less mature platform | ❌ Expensive for early stage |
| **Facebook Groups** | Massive reach, familiar to veterans | Poor discoverability, owned by Meta, no voice | ❌ Can't control platform |
| **Reddit** | Great for long-form discussion, SEO | Not real-time, harder to moderate | ⚠️ Use as supplement, not primary |

**Winner**: Discord for real-time collaboration, voice/video, low cost, and vibrant culture.
