## Critical Path to First Revenue

**Goal**: $1,500 (first Starter client) within 7 days

**Sequence** (in order, no skipping):

├─ Set up Calendly for discovery calls (30 min)
├─ Deploy intake form (Typeform/Tally) (1 hour)
└─ Set up Stripe payment links (1 hour)
   Total: 3 hours

Day 2:
├─ Find 5 partner attorneys (1 hour)
├─ Send partnership outreach emails (1 hour)
└─ Post resource hub in 3 veteran Facebook groups (30 min)
   Total: 2.5 hours

## What NOT to Do (Low ROI Traps)

❌ **Build full Discord server (20+ channels)** - 90% will be empty, creates maintenance burden
✅ **Start with 5 channels, add based on demand**

❌ **Create 10 training videos upfront** - Takes 20 hours, no guarantee anyone watches
✅ **Create 1 video based on most-asked question after 5 discovery calls**

❌ **Design custom website with branding** - Costs $5k-$10k, delays launch 4-8 weeks
✅ **Use GitHub Pages + resources.html, iterate based on feedback**

❌ **Recruit 10 attorney partners across 10 states** - Too much coordination overhead
✅ **Start with 1-2 attorneys in your state, expand to top 3 veteran states (TX, CA, FL)**

❌ **Build CCXT trading platform before any clients** - Premature optimization
✅ **Deliver Starter packages first, add Growth/Enterprise when demand proven**

❌ **Write comprehensive blog content library** - SEO takes 6-12 months
✅ **Leverage resources.html + email templates (immediate value)**

- Week 2: $1,500
- Week 3: $1,500
- Week 4: $1,500
- **Total**: $6,000

- Week 2: $4,500 Growth
- Week 3: $4,500 Growth
- Week 4: $4,500 Growth + $1,000 Enterprise = $5,500

**Recommended**: Start conservative ($6k Month 1), scale to moderate ($12k Month 2), aggressive ($20k Month 3)

---

## Decision Time

**What's the highest ROI move RIGHT NOW?**

**My recommendation**: The 3-Hour Launch Package (Today)

**Why**:
1. Unblocks entire sales funnel (market → lead → call → close → payment)
2. Zero dollars spent (all free tools)
3. Proves you're serious (live website > planning docs)
4. Generates first lead within 24-48 hours
5. Enables revenue this week vs "someday"

**Alternative** (if you prefer human connection first):
Skip tech setup, spend 3 hours on attorney partner recruitment. Get 1 attorney signed by Friday, then do tech setup over weekend. This validates the partnership model faster but delays lead generation.

---

## Your Call

What do you want to prioritize?

**Option A**: 3-Hour Launch Package (website + intake + booking + payment) → START MARKETING TODAY
