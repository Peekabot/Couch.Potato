## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### **Mistake 1: Choosing Oversaturated Products**
- ❌ Don't: Launch generic products (phone cases, generic supplements)
- ✅ Do: Find niche products with <500 competing listings, 30%+ margin
- **Test**: If top 10 listings all have 500+ reviews, market is too competitive

### **Mistake 2: Underfunding Inventory**
- ❌ Don't: Order 50 units and run out of stock in Week 2
- ✅ Do: Order 200-500 units for first batch (plan for 60-90 days of inventory)
- **Why**: Amazon penalizes out-of-stock listings (lose search ranking)

### **Mistake 3: Ignoring PPC from Day 1**
- ❌ Don't: Launch product and hope for organic sales
- ✅ Do: Budget $10-$20/day for PPC in first 30 days (builds momentum)
- **Result**: PPC drives initial sales → reviews → organic ranking improves

### **Mistake 4: Poor Quality Control**
- ❌ Don't: Order 500 units without testing samples
- ✅ Do: Order samples from 3 suppliers, test quality, negotiate improvements
- **Why**: Bad products = negative reviews = Amazon suspension

### **Mistake 5: No Exit Strategy**
- ❌ Don't: Build Amazon business with no plan to sell or scale
- ✅ Do: Track metrics (profit, repeat customer rate, brand value) for eventual sale
- **Opportunity**: Amazon businesses sell for 2-4x annual profit on Empire Flippers, Flippa
