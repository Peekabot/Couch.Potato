# Privacy Disclosure for Third-Party Resources

## Purpose
This disclosure explains how the Veteran Holding Company Platform handles third-party links, resource referrals, and data sharing related to educational and credentialing resources.

---

## What This Disclosure Covers

When you access resources through our platform (CLEP, American Heart Association, VA Education Benefits, SBA, Coursera, edX, Udemy, state veteran programs), you are navigating to **third-party websites and services** that are not controlled by the Veteran Holding Company Platform.

---

## Privacy & Data Sharing

### We Do NOT Share Your Personal Information
- **No automatic data transfer**: Clicking a resource link does NOT automatically send your personal information (name, address, SSN, email, phone) to third-party providers.
- **Explicit consent required**: We will NEVER share your personal data with third parties without your explicit, informed consent.
- **Secure intake**: All data collected via our intake form is encrypted and stored securely. It is only shared with partner attorneys and CPAs under attorney-client privilege or NDA.

### What Third Parties May Collect
When you visit a third-party resource (e.g., CLEP, Coursera, VA.gov):
- **Browsing data**: Third parties may collect your IP address, browser type, and referring URL (the fact that you came from our site).
- **Cookies and tracking**: Third-party sites may use cookies, analytics, and advertising trackers. We do not control these practices.
- **Account creation**: If you create an account or register for services, you are providing your information directly to the third party under THEIR privacy policy.

### Our Tracking (Optional)
- **UTM parameters**: Resource links may include UTM parameters (e.g., `?utm_source=vhcp&utm_medium=resources&utm_campaign=clep`) to help us measure which resources are most valuable to veterans.
- **Anonymous analytics**: We may track **aggregate, anonymized data** (e.g., "50 veterans clicked the CLEP link this month") to improve our resource offerings.
- **No personally identifiable information (PII)**: UTM tracking does NOT include your name, email, or other PII.
