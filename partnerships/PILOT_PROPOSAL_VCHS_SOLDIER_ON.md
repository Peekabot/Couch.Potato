### RISK MITIGATION

**Legal Compliance**:

- Platform provides coordination and templates only (not legal advice)

**Data Privacy**:
- All intake data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Shared with partner attorneys under NDA and attorney-client privilege
- HIPAA-level security practices for sensitive veteran information

**Quality Control**:
- Partner attorneys vetted for veteran experience and state licensing
- Standardized templates reduce errors and speed delivery
- Monthly check-ins ensure veterans are on track

**Exit Strategy**:
- If pilot underperforms (< 50% completion), we refund 50% of fees
- If partner dissatisfied, we provide full documentation for veteran continuity
- Veterans retain all deliverables regardless of pilot outcome
