## EMAIL A: Initial Intro to VCHS Albany (Warm, Partnership Focus)

**To**: [Director/Program Manager Name]@vchsalbany.org
**Subject**: Partnership opportunity to help Albany veterans form trusts and start businesses
**Attachment**: PILOT_PROPOSAL_VCHS_SOLDIER_ON.md (convert to PDF first)

**Body**:

Hello [First Name],

My name is Asa. I run a veteran-focused program that helps veterans form holding companies, set up trusts, and launch compliant small businesses and trading operations.

We combine legal intake, trust coordination with vetted attorneys, financial onboarding, and secure tech infrastructure—so veterans can move from idea to operating company with minimal friction and case management burden on your team.

I'd love to explore a partnership with VCHS Albany to offer a pilot program for your clients. The pilot runs 6-8 weeks and includes:

• Comprehensive intake and eligibility screening
• Coordinated attorney packet for trust drafting (RLT, ILIT, or SNT)
• LLC/Corp formation with EIN and operating agreement
• Corporate bank and exchange KYC packs
• Two group workshops (legal basics + business operations)
• 1-on-1 onboarding for each veteran
• 30-day and 90-day follow-up check-ins

What we bring to VCHS Albany:

• Standardized legal templates that reduce attorney hours (and costs)
• Secure tech stack for veterans interested in trading operations (optional)
• Education resource hub (CLEP, VA benefits, CPR, SBA training, etc.)
• Training materials and operational playbooks
• Measurable outcomes (entities formed, trusts executed, accounts funded)

Pilot capacity: 8 veterans per cohort
Pricing: Subsidized 50% for pilot ($750-$2,250 per veteran depending on package)
Timeline: Can launch within 2 weeks of approval

If this sounds useful, I've attached a one-page pilot proposal for your review. I'm available to meet at your convenience to walk through the program, share attorney credentials, and answer any questions.

Would you be open to a 30-minute call this week or next?

Best regards,
Asa

## EMAIL C: Short Referral Request (For Case Managers)

**To**: [Case Manager Name]@vchsalbany.org or @soldieron.org
**CC**: [Program Director if appropriate]
**Subject**: Quick referral request — veteran trust and business pilot (8 spots)

**Body**:

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick note — we're launching a pilot to help veterans form companies and trusts, and I'd love to accept a small number of referrals from your caseload.

What we handle for veterans:
• Legal intake and attorney coordination (trust drafting, entity formation)
• Financial onboarding (bank accounts, VA loan coordination)
• Operational training (bookkeeping, compliance, risk management)
• 6-8 week timeline from intake to fully operational business

What case managers don't need to do:
• Find attorneys or navigate legal complexities
• Coordinate with banks or exchanges (we provide KYC packs)
• Teach business operations (we provide training and templates)

If you have 1-3 veterans in your caseload who want to:
• Protect assets with a trust (estate planning)
• Start a small business or consulting practice
• Launch a trading operation (stocks, crypto, forex)
• Qualify for a VA home loan while structuring assets

...I'll take care of the rest and report back with outcomes at 30 and 90 days.

Pilot pricing: $750-$2,250 per veteran (50% subsidized, normally $1,500-$4,500)

I'll follow up with a simple one-page referral form you can use to introduce veterans to the program. Let me know if you'd like to chat briefly about the pilot structure.

Thanks for considering this for your clients!

Best,
Asa

Hello [First Name],

Following up on our earlier conversation, I've attached a concise pilot proposal for a 6-8 week program to help up to 8 veterans form holding companies and trusts, complete KYC, and receive onboarding to run compliant operations.

Pilot highlights:

• Intake and eligibility screening; attorney packet delivered within 7 days
• Trust drafting coordination with vetted attorneys (licensed in New York)
• LLC/Corp formation, EIN, and operating agreement
• Corporate bank/exchange KYC pack and secrets management setup
• Two workshops (legal basics, business operations) for all participants

Success metrics:
• 80%+ completion rate (6+ out of 8 veterans fully onboarded)
• Veteran satisfaction score ≥ 8/10
• Measurable outcomes (entities formed, trusts executed, accounts funded)

If you approve, we can schedule a kickoff meeting and begin veteran intake the following week. I'm targeting a 2-week turnaround from approval to program launch.
