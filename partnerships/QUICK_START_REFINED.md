Veterans want to start businesses and protect assets, but:

- Financial onboarding (Weeks 5-6)
- Total timeline: 6-8 weeks, fully operational

**Minute 6-8: The Pilot**
- 8 veterans, $750-$2,250 each (50% subsidized)
- You refer, we execute, you get measurable outcomes
- Success = entities formed, trusts executed, accounts funded
- Testimonials and case studies for both orgs

**Minute 9-11: What We Need**
- 8 veteran referrals (case managers identify eligible clients)
- Workshop space (2 sessions, 90 min each, in-person or virtual)
- Point of contact for coordination

**Minute 12-15: Next Steps**
- Kickoff meeting next week (30 minutes)
- Veteran recruitment (Week 1-2)
- Program launch (Week 3)
- Final outcomes report (Week 10)

**Close**: "Can we do a kickoff next Tuesday or Thursday?"
