```
Proposal → Vote → Execution
(democratic consensus)
```

---

### Decision Types

| Type | Examples | Threshold |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Operational** | Daily work, bug submissions | No vote needed |

## Financial Flow

### Revenue → Distribution

```
1. Revenue detected (Plaid API)
   ↓
2. Bond payments (6% APR) - FIRST PRIORITY
   ↓
3. Reserve top-up (15% NAV minimum)
   ↓
4. Member profit (ULU-weighted)
   ↓
5. Yield deployment (USDC @ 4-5%)
   ↓
6. ACH transfers (automated)
```

**Frequency**: Daily (24-hour cycle)

**Human intervention**: Zero

---

### Example Distribution

**Scenario**:
- Daily revenue: $500
- Bond obligations: $50 (daily)
- Reserve needs: $0 (already at 15%)
- Active members: Alice (40 ULU), Bob (20 ULU), Carol (20 ULU)
- Total ULU: 80

**Distribution**:
```
Revenue: $500
- Bonds: -$50
- Reserve: -$0
- Profit pool: $450

Member shares:
- Alice: $450 × (40/80) = $225
- Bob: $450 × (20/80) = $112.50
- Carol: $450 × (20/80) = $112.50
```

**Result**: Transferred to bank accounts automatically

---

## Communication

### Internal

**Tools**:
- Telegram (real-time chat)
- GitHub Issues (task tracking)
- GitHub Discussions (long-form)
- Financial dashboard (real-time metrics)

**Meetings**: Asynchronous only (no scheduled meetings)

---

## Comparison to Traditional

| Aspect | Traditional Company | Couch Potato |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Management** | CEO, managers, hierarchy | No managers, democratic votes |
| **Compensation** | Fixed salaries | ULU-weighted profit share |
| **Financing** | VC, loans, banks | Member bonds (6% APR) |
| **Decision-Making** | Top-down | Democratic consensus |
| **Transparency** | Limited (board only) | Full (all members) |
| **Automation** | Minimal | Maximum (90%+ automated) |
| **Exit** | Difficult (equity vesting) | Easy (callable bonds, instant ULU) |

---

## Why This Structure Works

### 1. **Eliminates Politics**

No promotions to fight over. No salary negotiations. No org chart battles.

**Result**: Focus on work, not politics

---

### 2. **Perfect Flexibility**

Want to work 10 hours this week? Fine, earn 10 ULU.
Want to work 60 hours next week? Fine, earn 60 ULU.

**Result**: Work-life balance + high performance

---

### 3. **Natural Meritocracy**

High performers self-select by working more hours.
Low performers self-select out (low earnings).

**Result**: No firing needed, natural attrition

---

### 4. **Infinite Scalability**

Add members without organizational complexity.
Each member = independent contributor.

**Result**: Linear growth, not exponential overhead

---

## Future Evolution

**Potential Changes** (member vote required):

1. **Tiered ULU**: Weight by skill/experience
2. **Profit Caps**: Max earnings per member
3. **Equity Conversion**: Convert bonds to ownership
4. **DAO Structure**: On-chain governance
5. **Token Issuance**: Native cryptocurrency

All require ≥66% supermajority vote.
