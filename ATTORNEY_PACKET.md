## Section 3: Trust Instrument Templates

### Revocable Living Trust (RLT) Template

**Use Case**: Most common for veterans. Provides probate avoidance, incapacity planning, and flexibility to amend.

**Key Provisions to Include**:
1. **Grantor/Settlor**: [Client Name] as grantor and initial trustee
2. **Trustee Succession**: Successor trustee upon incapacity or death
3. **Beneficiaries**: Spouse (if married), then children per stirpes
4. **Asset Schedule**: Schedule A listing all transferred assets
5. **Distribution Provisions**:
   - Immediate distribution to spouse (if surviving)
   - Children's trusts if minors (age-based distribution: 1/3 at 25, 1/3 at 30, remainder at 35)
6. **Incapacity Trigger**: Two physicians certify grantor unable to manage affairs
7. **Trustee Powers**: Broad investment, management, and distribution powers
8. **Amendment/Revocation**: Grantor retains right to amend or revoke during lifetime
9. **Spendthrift Clause**: Protects beneficiary assets from creditors
10. **Tax Provisions**: QTIP election for spouse, Crummey powers for ILIT (if applicable)

**Special Veteran Considerations**:
- **VA Benefits Preservation**: Language ensuring trust distributions don't disqualify beneficiaries from VA needs-based benefits
- **Disability Pay Protection**: If client receives VA disability, ensure trust doesn't trigger means-tested benefit loss
- **Life Insurance Coordination**: If veteran has SGLI/VGLI, consider ILIT for death benefit (see below)

**Sample Language (Non-Binding, State-Specific Review Required)**:

```
ARTICLE I: CREATION OF TRUST
[Client Name] ("Grantor") hereby creates an irrevocable/revocable trust effective [Date], to be known as the [Client Name] Revocable Living Trust.

ARTICLE II: TRUST ASSETS
The Grantor transfers to the Trustee the property described in Schedule A, attached hereto and incorporated by reference.

ARTICLE III: TRUSTEE PROVISIONS
A. Initial Trustee: [Client Name] shall serve as initial Trustee.
B. Successor Trustee: Upon the Grantor's death or incapacity, [Successor Name] shall serve as Successor Trustee.
C. Incapacity Determination: The Grantor shall be deemed incapacitated upon written certification by two licensed physicians.

ARTICLE IV: DISTRIBUTION DURING GRANTOR'S LIFETIME
During the Grantor's lifetime, the Trustee shall distribute income and principal as the Grantor directs. If incapacitated, the Trustee may distribute for the Grantor's health, education, maintenance, and support.

ARTICLE V: DISTRIBUTION UPON GRANTOR'S DEATH
Upon the Grantor's death:
A. All debts, taxes, and expenses shall be paid.
B. If the Grantor is survived by a spouse, all remaining trust assets shall be distributed to the spouse outright or in further trust (QTIP election available).
C. If no spouse survives, assets shall be divided equally among the Grantor's children, with minors' shares held in sub-trusts until age [25/30/35].

ARTICLE VI: SPENDTHRIFT PROVISION
No beneficiary may assign, pledge, or encumber any interest in the trust. Trust assets shall be protected from beneficiaries' creditors to the fullest extent permitted by law.

ARTICLE VII: AMENDMENT AND REVOCATION
The Grantor reserves the right to amend or revoke this trust at any time during the Grantor's lifetime.
```

**State-Specific Notes**:
- **Community Property States** (CA, TX, AZ, etc.): Include community property confirmation and spousal consent
- **Homestead States** (FL, TX): Coordinate trust transfer with homestead exemption preservation
- **Asset Protection States** (NV, WY, DE): Consider domestic asset protection trust (DAPT) language if client wants creditor protection

---

### Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT) Template

**Use Case**: Veterans with large life insurance policies (SGLI, VGLI, or private policies) who want to remove death benefits from taxable estate.

**Key Provisions**:
1. **Irrevocability**: Grantor cannot amend or revoke (critical for estate tax exclusion)
2. **Independent Trustee**: Cannot be grantor or spouse (must be independent to avoid estate inclusion)
3. **Crummey Powers**: Beneficiaries receive annual withdrawal rights (satisfies gift tax annual exclusion)
4. **Life Insurance Policy**: Trust owns policy, pays premiums via grantor gifts
5. **Distribution Provisions**: Death benefit distributed to spouse/children per trust terms
6. **Gift Tax Compliance**: Annual Crummey notices to beneficiaries documenting withdrawal rights

**Veteran-Specific Considerations**:
- **SGLI/VGLI Policies**: Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance can be assigned to ILIT; coordinate beneficiary change with VA
- **3-Year Lookback**: If transferring existing policy, death within 3 years causes estate inclusion (better to have ILIT purchase new policy)
- **VA Disability Coordination**: Ensure distributions don't disqualify dependents from VA education or health benefits

**Sample ILIT Structure**:

```
ARTICLE I: IRREVOCABILITY
This trust is irrevocable. The Grantor has no power to alter, amend, or revoke.

ARTICLE II: TRUST PURPOSE
The Trustee shall acquire and maintain a life insurance policy on the life of [Client Name] ("Insured"). The Trustee shall pay premiums using contributions from the Grantor.

ARTICLE III: CRUMMEY WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS
Upon each contribution, beneficiaries shall have a 30-day right to withdraw a pro-rata share (not to exceed the annual gift tax exclusion amount). The Trustee shall provide written notice ("Crummey Notice") to each beneficiary.

ARTICLE IV: DISTRIBUTION UPON INSURED'S DEATH
Upon receipt of death benefits:
A. Trustee may loan funds to Grantor's estate for liquidity (estate tax, debts)
B. Remaining proceeds distributed to spouse (if surviving) or held in sub-trusts for children

ARTICLE V: INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE
[Independent Trustee Name], not the Grantor or spouse, shall serve as Trustee to avoid estate inclusion under IRC §§ 2036-2038.
```

**Tax Compliance Checklist for ILIT**:
- [ ] Annual Crummey notices sent to beneficiaries
- [ ] Gifts documented (check register, wire transfer)
- [ ] Gift tax return (Form 709) if contributions exceed annual exclusion
- [ ] Policy ownership confirmed (beneficiary designation = ILIT, not individual)

---

### Special Needs Trust (SNT) Template (Third-Party)

**Use Case**: Veteran wants to provide for a child with disabilities without disqualifying them from SSI, Medicaid, or VA benefits.

**Key Provisions**:
1. **Third-Party Funded**: Funded by veteran (not beneficiary's assets)
2. **Supplemental Needs Only**: Distributions supplement, not replace, government benefits
3. **No Direct Distributions**: Trustee has discretion; beneficiary has no right to demand distributions
4. **Payback Provision**: Not required for third-party SNT (only for self-settled SNT)
5. **Independent Trustee**: Recommended to avoid conflicts

**Sample SNT Provision**:

```
ARTICLE I: SUPPLEMENTAL NEEDS PURPOSE
This trust is intended to supplement, not supplant, government benefits available to [Beneficiary Name]. Distributions shall be made solely for supplemental and extra care beyond that provided by public assistance.

ARTICLE II: TRUSTEE DISCRETION
The Trustee has absolute discretion to distribute or withhold distributions. The beneficiary has no right to demand distributions.

ARTICLE III: PROHIBITED DISTRIBUTIONS
The Trustee shall not make distributions that would disqualify the beneficiary from SSI, Medicaid, or VA means-tested benefits.
```

## Section 4: Operating Agreement Templates

ARTICLE VII: TRUST OWNERSHIP (If Applicable)

```

**Veteran-Specific Considerations**:
- **Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) Certification**: If pursuing government contracts, ensure operating agreement confirms veteran ownership and control
- **Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)**: If client has VA disability rating, include language documenting service-connected disability for set-aside contracts
- **Trust Ownership**: If LLC is owned by trust, confirm trust has authority to conduct business and hire employees

```

## Section 6: VA Home Loan Coordination

### Background
Veterans using VA home loans must coordinate trust ownership with VA underwriting requirements. VA lenders require the **veteran borrower** to hold legal title (not the trust) at closing, but post-closing transfer to trust is permitted.

### VA Loan + Trust Strategy

**Scenario 1: Veteran Buying Home with VA Loan (New Purchase)**
1. **At Closing**: Title in veteran's name individually (or joint with spouse)
2. **Post-Closing**: Transfer to revocable living trust via quitclaim deed (after 30-60 days)
3. **Lender Notification**: Not always required, but best practice to notify servicer

**Scenario 2: Veteran Refinancing with VA IRRRL (Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan)**
1. **Current Title**: May be in trust
2. **Refinance Requirement**: Temporarily transfer out of trust to veteran's name, refinance, then transfer back
3. **Timeline**: 7-14 days for title transfers

**Scenario 3: Veteran Using VA Loan for Investment Property (Not Primary Residence)**
- VA loans require **primary residence** occupancy, so investment properties are not eligible
- If veteran later converts primary residence to rental, trust ownership is fine (no VA loan restriction post-occupancy)

### Sample Memo to VA Lender

**Purpose**: Provide to lender during underwriting to explain trust structure and confirm veteran eligibility.

```
To: [Lender Name]
From: [Attorney Name], Partner Attorney, Veteran Holding Company Platform
Re: VA Loan Underwriting for [Client Name] - Trust Ownership

Dear [Lender Name],

Our client, [Client Name], is a U.S. military veteran eligible for VA home loan benefits. [He/She] has established a revocable living trust for estate planning purposes.

VA Loan Compliance:
- The veteran will take title in [his/her] individual name (or joint with spouse) at closing.
- Post-closing, the veteran intends to transfer the property to the [Trust Name] Revocable Living Trust via quitclaim deed.
- The veteran retains full beneficial ownership and control as grantor and trustee of the revocable trust.

This structure complies with VA underwriting guidelines and does not affect the veteran's eligibility or the VA guarantee.

Please contact me at [Phone/Email] if you need additional documentation (copy of trust instrument, trustee certification, etc.).

Sincerely,
[Attorney Name], Esq.
```

### Attorney Checklist for VA Loan Coordination

- [ ] Confirm veteran taking title individually at closing (not in trust name)
- [ ] Prepare post-closing quitclaim deed (trust transfer)
- [ ] Advise client to notify lender/servicer of transfer (best practice)
- [ ] Ensure due-on-sale clause not triggered (revocable trust transfers are exempt under Garn-St. Germain Act)
- [ ] Provide lender memo if requested during underwriting

---

## Section 7: Tax & Gift Planning Guidance

### Gift Tax Considerations

**Annual Exclusion (2025)**: $18,000 per donor, per donee
- Veteran can gift $18,000/year to each child (or trust) without filing Form 709
- Married couple can split gifts ($36,000/year per child)

**Lifetime Exemption (2025)**: $13.61 million per individual
- Gifts exceeding annual exclusion reduce lifetime exemption
- Form 709 required if exceeding annual exclusion

**ILIT Funding**: Crummey withdrawal rights allow annual exclusion gifts to ILIT

### Estate Tax Planning

**Current Exemption (2025)**: $13.61 million per individual ($27.22 million for married couple)
- Most veteran estates will not owe federal estate tax
- RLT and ILIT used for probate avoidance, asset protection, and beneficiary control (not primarily tax savings)

**Portability**: Surviving spouse can use deceased spouse's unused exemption (file Form 706 within 9 months)

### Income Tax Implications

**Revocable Living Trust**: Disregarded for income tax (grantor trust)
- Veteran reports all income/deductions on personal Form 1040
- No separate trust tax return during grantor's lifetime

**LLC Taxed as Disregarded Entity** (Single-Member LLC):
- Veteran reports business income on Schedule C (sole proprietor) or Schedule E (rental)
- No separate LLC tax return

**LLC Taxed as Partnership** (Multi-Member LLC):
- LLC files Form 1065 (partnership return)
- Members receive Schedule K-1

**LLC Taxed as S-Corp** (Election via Form 2553):
- Veteran receives W-2 wages + K-1 distributions
- Can reduce self-employment tax (payroll tax on wages only)

### CPA Coordination Points

**Attorney provides**:
- Copy of trust instrument
- Schedule A (trust assets)
- Assignment documents

**CPA advises on**:
- Entity tax election (S-Corp vs. disregarded entity)
- Estimated tax payments for trading income
- Quarterly bookkeeping and reconciliation
- Gift tax return (Form 709) if needed
- Estate tax return (Form 706) upon death
