## Inference: Is This Real Change or Stabilized Opposition?

### Apply the Prohibition Test

Compare each criterion to Prohibition benchmark:

| Criterion | Prohibition (Baseline) | This Case | Assessment |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------|------------|
| **Observable failures contradict stated intent** | ✅ Crime rose despite "reduce crime" goal | [Your case] | [✅ / ⚠️ / ❌] |
| **Economic/social costs mount measurably** | ✅ $500M lost revenue, enforcement costs | [Your case] | [✅ / ⚠️ / ❌] |
| **Enforcement cannot normalize violations** | ✅ Widespread speakeasies despite raids | [Your case] | [✅ / ⚠️ / ❌] |
| **Political coalitions begin to fracture** | ✅ Both parties shifted platforms by 1932 | [Your case] | [✅ / ⚠️ / ❌] |
| **No mechanism can absorb pressure** | ✅ Commissions failed, enforcement failed | [Your case] | [✅ / ⚠️ / ❌] |
| **Structural change less costly than continuation** | ✅ Repeal became economically/politically necessary | [Your case] | [✅ / ⚠️ / ❌] |

**Score**: [X/6 criteria met]

### Tolerance Analysis

**Is the tolerance threshold exceeded?**
- [YES / NO / UNCERTAIN]
- **Reasoning**: [What pressure is the system under? Can it absorb it?]

**Are feedback mechanisms working?**
- [YES / NO / UNCERTAIN]
- **Reasoning**: [Do observable failures trigger adaptation? Or absorption?]

**Has structural adaptation occurred?**
- [YES / NO / NOT YET]
- **Reasoning**: [What would count as structural change? Has it happened?]

### Critical Comparison

| Real Change (Prohibition) | This Case |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Observable failures mounted year-over-year | [Your analysis] |
| System could NOT absorb pressure | [Your analysis] |
| Political coalitions FORCED to shift | [Your analysis] |
| Structural reversal occurred (21st Amendment) | [Your analysis] |
| Timeline: Pressure → Break → Adapt (13 years) | [Your analysis] |

## Diagnosis

### Classification
**[Choose one]**:
- ✅ **Real Systemic Change**: Tolerance exceeded, feedback working, structural adaptation occurring/occurred
- ⚠️ **Approaching Breaking Point**: Some criteria met, system under strain, outcome uncertain
- ❌ **Stabilized Opposition**: System absorbing pressure, structure unchanged, dissent contained

### Reasoning
[Explain your classification based on the evidence and pattern analysis above]

### What Would Real Change Look Like?
[If this is stabilized opposition, what would have to happen for the pattern to break like Prohibition did?]

### Predictive Analysis
[Based on current patterns, what trajectory seems most likely? What would accelerate or prevent structural change?]

---

## Lessons for Analysis

### Key Insights
- [What does this case teach about systemic change vs stabilized opposition?]
- [What made this different from or similar to Prohibition?]
- [What are the limiting factors for change?]

### Actionable Diagnostics
- [If you were trying to create real change in this area, what would you target based on this analysis?]
- [Where is the system most/least able to absorb pressure?]
- [What feedback loops could be amplified or disrupted?]
