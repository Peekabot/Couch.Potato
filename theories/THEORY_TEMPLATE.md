# [Theory Name]

## What I'm Seeing

[1-2 paragraphs: What pattern/phenomenon prompted this? What's the observation?]

## Background / What Textbooks Say

[What's the standard explanation? Set up the tension between conventional wisdom and your insight]

## The Boundary Energy Angle

[How does this connect to the core boundary energy framework? What's the gradient? What's the discontinuity?]

### Math

[Work through the relevant equations. Keep it personal - show your thinking]
