# Email Draft: Request for Ball Lightning Spectroscopic Data

**To:** cenjianyong@nwnu.edu.cn
**CC:** yuanping@nwnu.edu.cn, xueshuai@nwnu.edu.cn
**Subject:** Request for Time-Resolved Spectroscopic Data from 2014 Ball Lightning Observation

---

Dear Dr. Cen,

I am writing to request access to the raw time-resolved spectroscopic data from your landmark 2014 observation of ball lightning (Cen et al., *Physical Review Letters* **112**, 035001, 2014).

## Data Requested

Specifically, I would like to obtain:

1. **Time-series intensity data** for nitrogen (N I) and oxygen (O I) emission lines
2. **Temporal resolution** sufficient to resolve the 100 Hz oscillation reported in your paper
3. **High-speed camera data** (3000 fps) if available

## Research Purpose

Your paper mentions that N and O emission oscillates at 100 Hz (twice the 50 Hz power line frequency). I wish to perform **Fourier analysis** to test for harmonic structure (200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz components).

## Hypothesis Being Tested

I am testing whether ball lightning exhibits resonant eigenmode behavior versus driven oscillation from the power line electromagnetic field:

- **Resonant eigenmode:** Should show harmonics at 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz
- **Driven oscillation:** Should show only the fundamental 100 Hz component

This distinction is critical for understanding whether ball lightning is a self-resonant plasma structure or simply responding to external EM fields.

## Theoretical Framework

This work is part of a broader investigation into phase transitions in plasma systems. The same mathematical framework applies to:
- Ball lightning (centimeter scale)
- Semiconductor phonon bottlenecks (nanometer scale)
- Neural network grokking (abstract energy landscapes)

All show threshold-driven eigenmode emergence. Your ball lightning data provides a macroscopic test case.

## Publications and Credit

Any results will be:
- Documented in our open-source theoretical framework repository (GitHub: Peekabot/Couch.Potato)
- Properly cited with full attribution to your original work
- Shared with you before any public release
- Open to collaboration if you are interested in co-authorship

I am happy to discuss any conditions for data use or sign a data sharing agreement if required.

## Technical Capability

I have experience with Fourier analysis and time-series processing. The analysis can be completed within days of receiving the data. I will share all analysis code and results with you.

## Timeline

There is no urgency, but I hope to complete this analysis within the next few months as part of a broader theoretical validation effort.

## Your Contribution to Science

Your 2014 measurement remains the **only spectroscopic observation of natural ball lightning** in the scientific literature. This makes your data uniquely valuable for testing theories of plasma self-organization and eigenmode structure.

The harmonic analysis I propose has not been performed on any ball lightning observation to my knowledge, making this a potential novel contribution to the field.

## Contact Information

I am available for discussion via email or video call if you have questions about this request or the theoretical framework being tested.

Thank you for considering this request and for your groundbreaking contribution to ball lightning research.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

## Attachments to Include

1. **Brief summary** of substrate phase transition theory (1-2 pages)
2. **Prediction document** showing what we expect to find (200 Hz harmonics)
3. **Analysis plan** (Fourier transform methodology)

## Follow-up Strategy

**If they respond positively:**
- Send data sharing agreement if needed
- Provide detailed analysis protocol
- Keep them updated on progress

**If they request collaboration:**
- Discuss co-authorship on any publications
- Offer to visit their institution if feasible
- Propose joint analysis approach

**If they decline:**
- Thank them respectfully
- Ask if they know of other ball lightning datasets
- Consider digitizing published figures as backup (lower quality but possible)

**If no response after 2 weeks:**
- Send polite follow-up
- Try contacting co-authors individually
- Search for other ball lightning spectroscopic data

---

## Backup Plan (If Data Unavailable)

1. **Digitize published figures** from their 2014 paper
   - Extract time-series from intensity plots
   - Lower resolution but might show 200 Hz if present

2. **Search for other datasets:**
   - Contact other ball lightning researchers
   - Check for unpublished observations
   - Look at lab-generated plasma fireballs (Ohtsuki experiments)

3. **Propose new observation:**
   - Collaborate with atmospheric physics groups
   - Deploy spectrographs in lightning-prone regions
   - This is expensive but definitive

**Priority:** HIGH (This is the $0 falsification test)

**Estimated timeline if successful:**
- Email sent: Today
- Response: 1-2 weeks
- Data received: 2-4 weeks
- Analysis complete: Days after data received
- Results documented: 1 week

**Total: 1-2 months to answer the question**
